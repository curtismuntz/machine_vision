Contains MATLAB coursework for EEE178- Machine Vision

feel free to use as reference

Unfortunately, most of the coursework is using images that I do not own. I have excluded the images from this repository. The code is pretty specific toward the images, but the concepts are shown in the code.

* HW1- basic arithmetic image processing
* Hw2- Gaussian Masks/ Filtering in space/frequency domains, custom convolution code
* HW3- More gaussian/frequency domain filtering & Discrete Cosine Transform
* HW4- Edge detection methods, space and frequency domains
* HW5- Edge detection, gradients, morphological operations
* HW6- Binary images and morphological operations
* Test1- 
* HW7- Morphological operations for object detections, hough transforms, circle detections
* HW8- Optical flow approaches
* HW9- Object detection using Neural Networks, minimum distance classifiers
* Test2-


* Project- Stereo Vision object tracking
